# Define a procedure histogram() that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:



def histogram():
    res = ['*'] * 4 
    print("4 : ",res)
    res = ['*'] * 7
    print("7:",res)
    res = ['*'] * 9
    print("9 :",res)
